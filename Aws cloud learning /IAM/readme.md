IAM, or Identity and Access Management, is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. IAM allows you to control who can access your AWS resources 

--IAM means: Identity  Acess  Management


I- Identity  calls in other terminal as (Authentication) . If you want to login Aws console we can use root account.
For example facebook accounts, Youtube accounts that kind of accounts like using  to log-in User ID, and Password. That is the mainthing 
If you have userID and password you can enter in that console and you can use every services


A- Access calls in other terminology as (Authorization).Who can access your account ? whoever take your credinstioals that persons can acess your account and use services.


M- Management (Authentication,Authorization) Cheking and maneged all those settings.


Here are some key features and functionalities of IAM:

1.Users: You can create individual IAM users within your AWS account and manage their permissions.Sign in to the AWS Management Console: Go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and sign in to the AWS Management Console with your AWS account credentials.


Open the IAM console: Once signed in, navigate to the IAM service by either typing "IAM" in the AWS services search bar or by finding it under the "Security, Identity, & Compliance" section in the AWS Management Console.


Navigate to Users: In the IAM console, locate the "Users" option on the left-hand side navigation pane and click on it.


Click "Add user": This will start the process of creating a new IAM user.


Enter user details:

User name: Specify a name for the user.

Access type: Choose between "Programmatic access", "AWS Management Console access", or both, depending on the type of access the user needs.

Console password: If you've chosen "AWS Management Console access", you'll need to set a password for the user.

Require password reset: Select this option if you want the user to set their password upon first login.

Permissions: Attach policies to the user to define what actions they can perform. You can choose existing policies or create custom ones.


Set permissions:You can attach existing policies to the user to grant them specific permissions. AWS provides many managed policies covering various services and permissions. Alternatively, you can create custom policies tailored to your requirements.


Review: Review the user details and permissions to ensure they're correct.


Create user: Once everything looks good, click on the "Create user" button.


Note the credentials: After the user is created, you'll be provided with the user's access key ID and secret access key. These are crucial for programmatic access and should be stored securely. If you chose "AWS Management Console access", the user will also receive an email with instructions on how to set up their password and log in.


2 Groups: You can organize IAM users into groups and assign permissions to those groups, making it easier to manage permissions for multiple users.
Enter group details:

Group name: Specify a name for the group.

Attach policy: You can attach existing policies to the group to grant specific permissions. AWS provides many managed policies covering various services and permissions. Alternatively, you can create custom policies tailored to your requirements.

Review: Review the group details and attached policies to ensure they're correct.


Create group: Once everything looks good, click on the "Create group" button.



Add users to the group:


After creating the group, you'll be taken to a page where you can add users to the group.

Click on the "Add users to group" button.

Select the users you want to add to the group from the list of available IAM users.

Click on the "Add users" button to add them to the group.



3 Roles: IAM roles are used to delegate permissions to entities that you trust. For example, you can create roles for applications running on EC2 instances to access other AWS services without needing to manage credentials directly.

Roles are commonly used for various purposes, including granting temporary permissions to an IAM user or an AWS service, enabling cross-account access, or providing permissions to AWS services to access other AWS resources.


Here's a breakdown of key aspects of roles in AWS IAM:

Role Trust Policy: Every role has a trust policy that defines which entities are allowed to assume the role. This policy specifies the trusted entities (principals) and the conditions under which they can assume the role.

Permissions Policies: Like users and groups, roles can have permissions policies attached to them. These policies define the permissions granted to the role when it's assumed. Permissions policies can be managed inline with the role definition or attached as managed policies.

Temporary Security Credentials: When a role is assumed, temporary security credentials are issued to the entity assuming the role. These credentials typically include an access key ID, a secret access key, and a session token. These credentials have an expiration time, making them suitable for short-term access.

Cross-Account Access: Roles enable cross-account access, allowing entities in one AWS account to access resources in another account. This is often used in scenarios where a service or user in one account needs to perform actions on resources in another account.

Service Roles: AWS services, such as EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and others, can assume roles to perform actions on behalf of the service. These roles are referred to as service roles and are often used to grant specific permissions to services while minimizing the exposure of credentials.


4  Policies: IAM policies are JSON documents that define permissions. You can attach policies to IAM users, groups, or roles to specify what actions they are allowed or denied to perform on AWS resources.

Here are key aspects of AWS IAM policies:

JSON Structure: IAM policies are written in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. They consist of one or more statements, each containing an effect (allow or deny), a list of actions (API operations), a resource (on which the actions can be performed), and optional conditions.

Managed Policies: Managed policies are standalone policies that you can attach to multiple IAM identities (users, groups, or roles) across AWS accounts. AWS provides a set of managed policies covering common use cases, such as granting full access to specific AWS services, read-only access to resources, or access for specific tasks like billing management.

Inline Policies: Inline policies are policies that are directly attached to a single IAM identity (user, group, or role). These policies are embedded directly within the IAM identity's JSON representation and are unique to that identity. They are often used for specific permissions that are only applicable to a single user, group, or role.

Permission Boundaries: Permission boundaries are advanced IAM features that allow you to set the maximum permissions that an IAM entity (such as a user or role) can have. This can be useful for enforcing least privilege access while still allowing users to assume roles with a wider range of permissions when necessary.

Resource-based Policies: Apart from IAM policies, AWS also supports resource-based policies. These policies are attached directly to AWS resources like S3 buckets, SQS queues, and Lambda functions. Resource-based policies control access to the associated resource and can define who can perform actions on the resource and under what conditions.

Policy Variables and Conditions: IAM policies support variables and conditions that allow for fine-grained control over access permissions. You can use variables such as ${aws:username} or ${aws:userid} to reference information about the requester, and conditions to specify when a policy should be applied.


5 Multi-factor Authentication (MFA): IAM supports the use of MFA devices, such as hardware tokens or virtual MFA apps, to provide an extra layer of security for accessing AWS resources.

Here's how MFA typically works:

First Factor (Something You Know): The first factor is usually something the user knows, such as a username and password combination. This is the traditional method of authentication.

Second Factor (Something You Have): The second factor is something the user possesses, such as a smartphone, hardware token, or smart card. This factor is typically used to generate a one-time passcode (OTP) or receive a push notification.

Additional Factors: Some authentication systems may require additional factors, such as something the user is (biometric authentication like fingerprint or facial recognition) or somewhere the user is (geolocation).

MFA provides a higher level of security compared to single-factor authentication because even if an attacker manages to steal or guess a user's password, they would still need access to the second factor to successfully authenticate.

In the context of AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management), MFA can be enabled for individual IAM users. When MFA is enabled, users are required to provide both their regular credentials (username and password) and a valid MFA code generated by a hardware or software token associated with their account.

AWS provides several options for implementing MFA:

Virtual MFA Device: Users can use a virtual MFA device, such as Google Authenticator or Authy, to generate MFA codes on their smartphone or tablet.

Hardware MFA Device: Users can use a physical hardware token (like YubiKey) to generate MFA codes.

SMS Text Message MFA: AWS can send MFA codes via SMS to the user's registered mobile phone number.
